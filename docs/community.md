# Purpose

The purpose of `AIS-catcher` is to serve as a platform that encourages the perpetual enhancement of receiver models. We greatly value and appreciate any suggestions, observations, or shared recordings, particularly from setups where the existing models encounter difficulties.

## The aiscatcher.org community

AIS-catcher is a free, open-source project aimed at transforming SDR-equipped computers into AIS-receivers. It's continuously improved with decoding enhancements, user support, and expanded output options for commercial data aggregators. As a seperate project we also aggregate AIS data with the aim of real-time visualization in local web dashboards, enhancing receiver performance and situational awareness by integrating nearby station data.

To join, ensure you're on the latest version, visit [aiscatcher.org](https://aiscatcher.org), and [add](https://aiscatcher.org/addstation) your station. Upon registration, you'll receive a personal sharing key. Simply run AIS-catcher on the command line with "-X" followed by your sharing key to share your station's raw AIS data with the community hub. This activates a "Community Feed" in your station's web viewer, accessible under map layers and some other features.

Check the data we're receiving at [aiscatcher.org](https://aiscatcher.org). We welcome your innovative ideas for enhancing AIS-catcher with this collective data, which could lead to new features or improvements benefiting the entire community.
