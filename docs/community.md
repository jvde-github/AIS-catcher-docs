# Purpose

**AIS-catcher** is designed to be a dynamic platform that fosters the continuous improvement of AIS receiver models. We highly value and welcome any suggestions, observations, or shared recordings, especially from setups where current models face challenges.

## Join the aiscatcher.org Community

**AIS-catcher** is a free and open-source project dedicated to transforming computers equipped with Software-Defined Radios (SDRs) into robust Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers. Our mission is to enhance AIS data decoding, provide a versatile tool that supports various input and output methods, and aggregate AIS data at [aiscatcher.org](https://aiscatcher.org) to enable real-time global visualization. Integrating this aggregated data into local web viewers offers a powerful tool to calibrate and improve station performance by identifying its limitations and blind spots.
