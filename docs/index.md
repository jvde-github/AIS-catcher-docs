## What is AIS?

The **Automatic Identification System (AIS)** is a vital maritime safety technology, akin to **ADSB** used in aviation. AIS enables real-time tracking of vessels by transmitting critical information such as position, speed, and heading over **VHF radio frequencies** (around **162 MHz**). This data enhances maritime navigation safety, situational awareness, and traffic management.
