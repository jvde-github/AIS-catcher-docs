# AIS-Catcher

Welcome to the documentation pages for **AIS-Catcher**, an open-source software package developed to transform your general-purpose Software Defined Radio (SDR)-equipped computer into a powerful, dual-channel AIS receiver. AIS-Catcher bridges the gap between affordable SDR devices like the **RTL-SDR** and expensive commercial AIS receivers, giving you complete control over maritime data monitoring and sharing.

Whether you're a maritime enthusiast, researcher, or data aggregator, AIS-Catcher offers advanced features, cross-platform compatibility, and a user-friendly setup to meet your needs. 

## What is AIS?

The **Automatic Identification System (AIS)** is a maritime safety technology similar to **ADSB** used in aviation. AIS provides real-time information such as a vesselâ€™s position, speed, and heading by transmitting messages over **VHF radio frequencies** (around **162 MHz**). 


## Free Open-Source
The sofware is Free Open Source publisched under  GPL3 and can be installed from these docs or our [Github](https://github.com/jvde-github/AIS-catcher)) account.

## Community Features

AIS-catcher offers a vibrant community through our website [aiscatcher.org](https://aiscatcher.org). This platform serves two main purposes:

1. **Station Performance Tracking**  
   Monitor your AIS receiver's performance and compare it with other stations in your area.

2. **Global Ship Movement Overview**  
   Access a comprehensive view of maritime traffic from our network of contributors.

## Design criteria of AIS-Catcher

AIS-Catcher is a tool for decoding and analyzing AIS signals from ships, allowing you to monitor vessel movements, improve situational awareness, and contribute to the maritime community.

### **Key Features**
- **Multi-Platform Compatibility**  
  Runs seamlessly on Windows, Ubuntu/Debian, Raspberry Pi, macOS, and even inside Docker containers.
  
  - **Sensitive Decoder**
  The decoder has been designed to extract maximum performance from the available SDR hardware 

  - **Lightweight and Efficient**  
  Written in C++ and optimized for high performance and small footprint on low-power devices like Raspberry Pi.

- **Wide SDR Support**  
  Works with popular SDRs like RTL-SDR, AirSpy, AirSpy HF+ HackRF, SDRPlay, and more.

- **Flexible Outputs**  
  Send AIS data in NMEA format, JSON. Stream data to databases, MQTT brokers, or external software like OpenCPN.

- **Built-In Web Viewer**  
  Access real-time AIS data and system statistics through a web-based interface with advanced customization options and plugin system.

- **Community Exchange**
  Share data with community feed (aiscatcher.org) abd receive position reports from nearby station in the local Web Viewer for performance tuning

AIS-catcher began as a basic decoder for RTL-SDR dongles, offering on-screen output and UDP transmission for key aggregation sites. Over time, we've expanded its compatibility to include a wider range of SDRs and input methods. On the output side, it now supports viewing signals and positions through a web viewer, saving to databases, and forwarding as NMEA2000 on Linux systems using socketCAN. This enhancement has subtly shifted AIS-catcher's role, making it a useful tool for managing different AIS data streams. Below is a cheatsheet for the various input and output modes.
