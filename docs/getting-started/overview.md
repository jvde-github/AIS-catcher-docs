The Web GUI management interface is available exclusively for Raspberry Pi and Docker deployments as a separate package to ease configuration and management of the receiver. Key features include:

- Background service management
- Configuration interface
- System monitoring

Note: Manual configuration edits may limit certain GUI functionality. The interface provides a lightweight solution ideal for Linux newcomers.
