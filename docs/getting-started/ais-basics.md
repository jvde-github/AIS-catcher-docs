# Introduction to Automatic Identification System (AIS)

The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a maritime communication technology that significantly enhances safety and efficiency in navigation. AIS enables vessels to automatically share real-time information—including identity, position, speed, and heading—with nearby ships and coastal monitoring stations. Operating on Very High Frequency (VHF) radio waves, AIS ensures reliable transmission over considerable distances, which is crucial for maritime operations.

## Key Details

### Frequency Range

AIS operates within the VHF band around 162 MHz, utilizing four dedicated channels:

* 161.975 MHz (AIS 1, Channel A)
* 162.025 MHz (AIS 2, Channel B)
* 156.775 MHz (AIS 3, Channel C)
* 156.825 MHz (AIS 4, Channel D)

Channels A and B are used for standard ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communications, while channels C and D are dedicated to long-range applications using satellite detection.

### Data Transmission

AIS messages are transmitted using a standardized digital format defined by international maritime organizations. This standardization enables seamless sharing of crucial navigation data between vessels and shore-based stations, facilitating coordination and safety at sea.

### Applications

* **Collision Avoidance**: Enhances situational awareness to prevent collisions in crowded waterways.
* **Traffic Monitoring**: Allows port authorities and maritime traffic services to monitor and manage vessel movements.
* **Navigation Aid**: Improves navigation in poor visibility conditions, such as fog or heavy rain.
* **Search and Rescue**: Assists in locating vessels during emergencies.
* **Fleet Management**: Enables tracking and management of commercial shipping fleets.

## Receiving AIS with Software Defined Radio (SDR)

Advancements in Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology have made it possible to receive and process AIS messages without expensive, dedicated equipment. By tuning an SDR device to the AIS frequencies (around 162 MHz), users can monitor and decode AIS signals using accessible hardware and software solutions.

### Why Use SDR for AIS?

* **Cost-Effective**: SDR devices are more affordable than specialized AIS receivers, making AIS monitoring accessible to hobbyists and professionals alike.
* **Versatile**: SDR hardware can receive a wide range of frequencies, allowing users to monitor various VHF/UHF signals in addition to AIS.
* **Customizable**: Open-source software like AIS-catcher enables users to decode and analyze AIS signals, view detailed vessel information, and integrate data with other systems.

### Important Safety Notice

SDR-based AIS receivers should **not** be used for:

* Navigation purposes
* Safety of life applications
* Commercial vessel operations
* Any situation requiring certified equipment

These systems are intended for hobby and research purposes only. For maritime safety and navigation, always use type-approved AIS transponders and receivers that meet international maritime standards.
