# Contributing Data

There are two ways to share your AIS data with our community:

## Users of AIS-catcher
If you're running AIS-Catcher, you can enable community sharing through a simple [configuration setting](../configuration/output/community-feed.md). This allows direct integration with our platform.

## Existing stations 
Already feeding data to other aggregators like MarineTraffic, VesselFindr, ShipXplorer? You can easily contribute to our community too:

1. [Request a dedicated UDP port](https://aiscatcher.org/addstation_udp)
2. Configure your existing station to forward RAW NMEA data
3. Start contributing to our global network

Join our growing community of maritime enthusiasts and help expand global AIS coverage!
